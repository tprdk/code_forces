You are given an integer n. In one move, you can either multiply n by two or divide n by 6 (if it is divisible by 6 without the remainder).

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from n or determine if it's impossible to do that.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤109).

Output
For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from n if it's possible to do that or -1 if it's impossible to obtain 1 from n.
